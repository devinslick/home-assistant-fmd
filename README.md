| Cell Only location | ‚ö° Minimal | Fast/rough location |
| Last Known location | ‚ö° None | No new request needed |
| Photo capture | ‚ö°‚ö° Medium | As needed |

### Home Assistant Resource Usage

**Storage:**
- Photos: ~2-3 MB per photo
- Default 10 photos = ~25 MB per device
- Max 50 photos = ~125 MB per device
- Location data: Negligible (<1 MB)

**Network:**
- Location poll: ~1-5 KB per request
- Photo download: ~2-3 MB per photo
- Encrypted data transfer (HTTPS recommended)

**CPU:**
- Decryption: Minimal (async operations)
- Photo processing: Medium (EXIF extraction)
- Normal operation: Low impact

### Optimization Tips

**For Battery Life:**
- Use "Cell Only (Fast)" when battery < 30%
- Use "GPS Only (Accurate)" when charging
- Increase normal polling interval (60+ minutes)
- Disable high frequency mode when not needed

**For Accuracy:**
- Location Source: "GPS Only (Accurate)"
- Allow Inaccurate Locations: OFF
- High Frequency Mode: ON (when tracking actively)

**For Storage:**
- Set Max Photos to 5-10 (not 50)
- Manually delete old photos periodically
- Consider automation to clean media folder

## Photo Workflow

The integration provides complete photo management functionality:

1. **Capture a Photo:**
   - Press "Capture Front Camera" or "Capture Rear Camera" button
   - Wait 15-30 seconds for device to capture and upload to server

2. **Download Photos:**
   - Set "Max Photos to Download" to desired number (default: 10)
   - Press "Download Photos" button
   - Photos are fetched, decrypted, and saved to `/config/media/fmd/<device-id>/` or `/media/fmd/<device-id>/`

3. **View Photos:**
   - Navigate to **Media** ‚Üí **FMD** in Home Assistant
   - Click on your device folder (e.g., `test-user`)
   - Browse photos in grid view
   - Click to view full size
   - Use photos in automations or notifications

**Photo Storage:**
- Location: `/media/fmd/<device-id>/` (Docker/Core/K8s) or `/config/media/fmd/<device-id>/` (HAOS)
- Format: `photo_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<hash>.jpg` (timestamp from EXIF data + content hash)
  - Example: `photo_20251019_150034_705a8c9f.jpg`
  - Timestamp extracted from EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` tag (when photo was captured)
  - Falls back to `photo_<hash>.jpg` if EXIF data is missing
- Size: ~2-3 MB per photo
- Organization: Each device has its own subdirectory
- Chronological sorting: Photos appear in capture order thanks to timestamp prefix
- Duplicate prevention: Content hash suffix prevents re-downloading identical photos
- No automatic polling - photos are downloaded only when requested

## Device Control
The integration provides remote control commands for your FMD device:

### Location Source Selection
Configure which location provider the Location Update button uses:
- **All Providers (Default)**: Uses GPS, network, and fused location for best reliability
- **GPS Only (Accurate)**: Most accurate but slower, requires clear sky view, uses more battery
- **Cell Only (Fast)**: Fast but less accurate, uses cellular tower triangulation
- **Last Known (No Request)**: Returns cached location without new GPS request (instant, no battery use)

Use the Location Source select entity to change the provider. The setting persists and will be used by the Location Update button.

**Example automation for battery-conscious tracking:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "FMD: Use GPS when charging, Cell when on battery"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.my_phone_is_charging
    action:
      - service: select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: select.fmd_test_user_location_source
        data:
          option: >
            {% if trigger.to_state.state == 'on' %}
              GPS Only (Accurate)
            {% else %}
              Cell Only (Fast)
            {% endif %}
```

### Bluetooth Control
Use the Bluetooth command select entity to enable or disable Bluetooth:
- Select "Enable Bluetooth" to turn on Bluetooth
- Select "Disable Bluetooth" to turn off Bluetooth
- Requires Android 12+ BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission
- Entity resets to "Send Command..." after sending

### Do Not Disturb Control
Use the DND command select entity to control Do Not Disturb mode:
- Select "Enable Do Not Disturb" to enable DND
- Select "Disable Do Not Disturb" to disable DND
- Requires Do Not Disturb Access permission
- Useful for bedtime automations or meeting mode

### Ringer Mode Control
Use the Ringer Mode command select entity to change device ringer:
- Select "Normal (Sound + Vibrate)" for full sound
- Select "Vibrate Only" for vibrate-only mode
- Select "Silent" for silent mode (also enables DND)
- Requires Do Not Disturb Access permission

### Device Wipe (Factory Reset)
‚ö†Ô∏è **DANGEROUS COMMAND** - Permanently erases all data on the device!

To protect against accidental wipes, this feature requires a two-step process:

1. **Enable Safety Switch:**
   - Turn on the "‚ö†Ô∏è Wipe: Safety switch"
   - This allows the wipe button to function
   - ‚è∞ **Automatically disables after 60 seconds**

2. **Press Wipe Button:**
   - While safety switch is enabled, press "‚ö†Ô∏è Wipe: Execute" button
   - Device will be factory reset (all data erased)
   - Safety switch automatically disables after use

**Use Cases:**
- Device is lost/stolen and you want to protect your data
- Device needs to be decommissioned or sold
- Final resort for security/privacy protection

**Important Notes:**
- This command **CANNOT BE UNDONE**
- All data: apps, files, photos, accounts (EVERYTHING!) will be deleted
- Device will return to factory settings
- You'll need physical access to set up the device again

**Note:** Bluetooth, DND, and Ringer commands are fire-and-forget. Home Assistant doesn't track the actual device state, so the select entities always show "Send Command..." as a placeholder.

## Security & Privacy

### Best Practices

**üîê Secure Your FMD Server**
- Use HTTPS (not HTTP) for your FMD server URL
- Use strong, unique passwords (20+ characters recommended)
- Run FMD server on a private network or VPN
- Keep FMD server software updated
- Use firewall rules to restrict access

**üîë Home Assistant Security**
- Enable authentication on Home Assistant
- Use strong passwords or API tokens
- Consider network isolation for device tracking
- Regularly review Home Assistant logs
- Keep Home Assistant updated

**üì± Android App Permissions**

The FMD Android app requires these permissions:
- ‚úÖ Location (always) - For tracking
- ‚úÖ Camera - For photo capture
- ‚úÖ Device Admin - For lock/wipe commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bluetooth (Android 12+) - For Bluetooth control
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Disturb Access - For DND/ringer commands

**Grant permissions cautiously** - only enable what you need.

**üö® Device Wipe Protection**

The integration includes multiple safety layers:
1. **Safety switch required** - Must enable before wipe works
2. **60-second timeout** - Safety auto-disables after 1 minute
3. **Extensive logging** - CRITICAL warnings in logs
4. **Auto-disable after use** - Prevents repeated presses
5. **Cannot be undone** - Final warning in documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy Considerations**
- Location data is encrypted in transit (RSA + AES-GCM)
- Photos are encrypted on FMD server
- Data is decrypted only on Home Assistant
- Photos stored locally on Home Assistant
- Review Home Assistant's `media/fmd/` permissions
- Consider who has access to your Home Assistant instance

**üí° Recommendations**
- Use this integration only on devices you own
- Inform device users they are being tracked
- Comply with local laws regarding tracking/surveillance
- Use device wipe only as last resort
- Test features in safe environment first
- Keep backups of important device data

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Do I need to run my own FMD server?**  
A: Yes, this integration requires a self-hosted or hosted FMD server. The integration connects to YOUR server, not a centralized service. See [FMD Server setup](https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-server).

**Q: Does this work without the FMD Android app?**  
A: No, you must install the FMD Android app on the device you want to track. The app communicates with the FMD server.

**Q: Can I track multiple devices?**  
A: Yes! Add a new integration instance for each device. Each device gets its own set of 19 entities.

**Q: Why is my location not updating?**  
A: Check: 1) Device has internet, 2) FMD app is running, 3) Location permissions granted, 4) Device is sending data to server (check FMD server logs).

**Q: How do I know if a command was received?**  
A: Commands are fire-and-forget. Check device physically or use another method to confirm. There's no acknowledgment from the device.

**Q: Can I see Bluetooth/DND state in Home Assistant?**  
A: No, FMD doesn't support querying device state. Commands are one-way only.

**Q: How much battery does this use?**  
A: Normal mode: minimal (just checks server). High frequency mode: significant (actively requests GPS). See [Performance](#performance--resource-usage).

**Q: Where are photos stored?**  
A: `/media/fmd/<device-id>/` (Docker/Core) or `/config/media/fmd/<device-id>/` (HAOS). Photos appear in Media Browser automatically.

**Q: Can I download photos older than the configured max?**  
A: No, increase "Max Photos to Download" setting before pressing "Download Photos" to get more history.

**Q: Is my data encrypted?**  
A: Yes! Location and photos are encrypted end-to-end using RSA-3072 + AES-GCM. Only your Home Assistant instance can decrypt.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally press the wipe button?**  
A: Nothing! The safety switch must be enabled first. The wipe button is blocked by default.

**Q: Can I undo a device wipe?**  
A: No, device wipe is permanent. All data is erased. This is an FMD feature, not controllable by this integration.

**Q: Does this work on iOS/iPhone?**  
A: No, FMD is Android-only. This integration only works with Android devices running the FMD app.

**Q: Can I use this for fleet/business tracking?**  
A: Yes, the MIT License allows commercial use. Add one integration instance per device.
