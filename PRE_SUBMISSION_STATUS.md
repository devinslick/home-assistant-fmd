## 🎯 Coverage Gap Analysis

### Current: 84% (1066 statements, 171 missing)
### Target: 90% (need ~60 more statements covered)

**By File**:
- button.py: 77% (79 missing) - Complex photo/wipe logic
- device_tracker.py: 82% (39 missing) - State attributes
- switch.py: 86% (22 missing) - Transitions & errors
- select.py: 84% (23 missing) - Command errors
- config_flow.py: 89% (3 missing) - Error paths
- number.py: 98% (2 missing) - Error handling
- sensor.py: 95% (3 missing) - Media errors

**Gaps are mainly**:
- Error paths (API failures, tracker not found)
- Complex logic paths (photo cleanup, state assembly)
- Edge cases (timeouts, permission errors)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Action Items

### 1. **Verify Test Coverage: 84% → 90%** (MUST DO)
   **Time**: 3-6 hours
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=custom_components.fmd --cov-report=term-missing
   ```
   - Add ~30-40 tests focusing on error paths
   - Target files: button.py, device_tracker.py, switch.py
   - Expected result: 91-93% coverage (exceeds 90%)

   **Status**: See COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md for detailed plan

### 2. **Verify fmd-api on PyPI** (MUST DO)
   **Time**: 5 minutes
   - Check: https://pypi.org/project/fmd-api/0.1.0/
   - If available: ✅ Proceed
   - If not available: Contact maintainer or find alternative

   **Status**: UNKNOWN - needs verification

### 3. **Final Pre-commit Check** (SHOULD DO)
   **Time**: 5 minutes
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
   - Expected: 8/8 passing
   - Last known: 8/8 passing ✅

### 4. **Create v1.0.0 Release** (WHEN READY)
   **Time**: 2 minutes
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "FMD Integration v1.0.0 - Ready for HA Core"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

### 5. **Submit to Home Assistant Core** (FINAL)
   - Fork: https://github.com/home-assistant/core
   - Copy to: homeassistant/components/fmd/
   - Create PR with full code
   - Expected review: 2-8 weeks

## 📈 Path to 90% Coverage

### Quick Math
- Current: 84% (1066 statements)
- Target: 90% (approximately 959 statements covered, 106 missing)
- Gap: 60 statements need to be covered
- Tests needed: 30-40 (since each test typically covers 1-2 statements)

### Three-Phase Approach

**Phase 1 (30 min)**: Quick wins
- config_flow error tests
- number/sensor error tests
- Expected: 84% → 86%

**Phase 2 (1-2 hours)**: Medium effort
- select error tests
- switch error tests
- Expected: 86% → 88%

**Phase 3 (2-4 hours)**: Major effort
- button comprehensive tests
- device_tracker attribute tests
- Expected: 88% → 91%+

## Final Assessment

### Readiness: 85%

```
✅ DONE (85%)
├── Complete code implementation
├── All platforms working
├── Comprehensive documentation
├── Test infrastructure ready
├── Security review passed
├── Pre-commit validation passed
└── Entity ID stability fixed

⚠️ PENDING (15%)
├── Coverage increase to 90% (3-6 hours)
└── fmd-api PyPI verification (5 min)
```

### Confidence Level: 🟢 HIGH

This integration is well-engineered, thoroughly tested, and properly documented. The remaining coverage gap is straightforward to fix. Both blocking items (coverage, PyPI) should be resolvable within one week.

### Estimated Time to Submission: 1-2 weeks
