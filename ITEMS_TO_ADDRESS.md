## ⚠️ ITEMS REQUIRING ACTION (Before Submission)

### 1. ⭐ CRITICAL: Improve Test Coverage to 90%+

**Current Status**: 84% coverage (1066 statements, 171 missing)
**Target**: 90% (approximately 960 statements)
**Gap**: 6% (about 60 statements)
**Time to Complete**: 3-6 hours

**What's Missing**:
- Error path tests in button.py (79 missing lines)
- State attribute tests in device_tracker.py (39 missing lines)
- Command error tests in select.py (23 missing lines)
- State transition tests in switch.py (22 missing lines)
- A few edge cases in config_flow.py, number.py, sensor.py

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Phase 1 (30 min): Quick wins in config_flow, number, sensor
2. Phase 2 (1-2 hrs): Error tests in select, switch
3. Phase 3 (2-4 hrs): Comprehensive tests in button, device_tracker
4. Verify: `pytest --cov` shows ≥90%

**Reference**: See `COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed test list

**Status**: 🔴 NOT STARTED - HIGH PRIORITY

---

### 2. ⭐ CRITICAL: Verify fmd-api Package on PyPI

**Current Status**: Unknown
**Requirement**: fmd-api==0.1.0 must be on PyPI
**Time to Complete**: 5 minutes
**Impact**: Blocking issue if package isn't available

**What to Check**:
1. Visit: https://pypi.org/project/fmd-api/
2. Search for version 0.1.0
3. If available: ✅ You're good
4. If not available:
   - Either publish it to PyPI
   - Or contact fmd-api maintainer
   - Consider relaxing version: `fmd-api>=0.1.0,<0.2.0`

**Status**: 🔴 NOT VERIFIED - MUST DO

---

## 🟢 OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED

### 3. Create Release Notes for v1.0.0

**Purpose**: Document what's included in the first stable release
**Time to Complete**: 15 minutes
**Format**: Add to README.md or create CHANGELOG.md

**Contents**:
- Summary of features (20 entities, photo download, device control)
- Breaking changes (none for first release)
- Installation instructions
- Known limitations

**Status**: 🟡 RECOMMENDED - Can do anytime

---

### 4. Test on Additional Python Versions (Optional)

**Current**: Python 3.11 & 3.12 tested in CI/CD
**Optional Check**: Python 3.13 if released
**Time**: 5 minutes per version

**Status**: 🟡 OPTIONAL - Already have 3.11 & 3.12

---

### 5. Review Manifest.json Against HA Requirements (Optional)

**Current Status**: manifest.json looks complete
**Optional**: Cross-check against latest HA Core requirements
**Reference**: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest/

**Status**: 🟡 OPTIONAL - Likely already correct

## 📝 Detailed Action Steps

### For Test Coverage (Most Important)

1. **Analyze current gaps**:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=custom_components.fmd --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

2. **Review coverage analysis**:
   - See `COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md` for line-by-line breakdown
   - Prioritize by file (button.py first, then device_tracker.py)

3. **Add tests incrementally**:
   ```bash
   # Test one file at a time
   pytest tests/test_button.py --cov=custom_components.fmd.button --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

4. **Commit after each module** (keeps history clean)

5. **Final verification**:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=custom_components.fmd --cov-report=term-missing
   # Should show ≥90%
   ```

### For fmd-api Verification

1. Open: https://pypi.org/project/fmd-api/
2. Look for version 0.1.0
3. Document finding in PR/commit message
4. If not found: Contact fmd-api maintainer or investigate alternatives

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to fix all 171 missing statements?**
A: No, just enough to reach 90% coverage. ~60 statements should do it.

**Q: Can I submit before reaching 90%?**
A: No, 90% is a hard requirement for Home Assistant Core integrations.

**Q: How long will HA Core review take?**
A: Typically 2-8 weeks. Be prepared to address review comments.

**Q: What if I can't add all those tests?**
A: Each test is optional. Just add enough to hit 90% coverage.

**Q: Can I submit if fmd-api isn't on PyPI?**
A: No, all dependencies must be available on PyPI for HA Core.
