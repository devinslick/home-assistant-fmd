## FMD (Find My Device) Project

This Home Assistant integration is built to work with the **FMD (Find My Device)** open source project, maintained by the FMD-FOSS team.

### FMD Project Links

- **FMD Server**: https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-server

### FMD Team

The FMD project was created and is maintained by:

- **Nulide** (Founder) - http://nulide.de
- **Thore** (Maintainer) - https://thore.io

### What is FMD?

FMD (Find My Device) is a free and open source Android app and server that allows you to:
- Track your device location
- Send commands remotely (ring, lock, wipe, etc.)
- Take photos remotely
- Control device settings

The FMD team has created both:
1. **FMD Android App** - Runs on your Android device to respond to commands
2. **FMD Server** - Self-hosted server that stores encrypted location data and relays commands

### This Integration's Role

This Home Assistant custom integration (`home-assistant-fmd`) acts as a **client** for the FMD server:
- Fetches encrypted location data from your FMD server
- Sends commands to your device via the FMD server
- Displays device information in Home Assistant

**Important**: This integration requires you to:
1. Install the FMD Android app on your device
2. Run your own FMD server (or use a hosted instance)
3. Configure the FMD app to connect to your server

This integration does **not** include or redistribute any FMD server or Android app code. It simply communicates with your existing FMD infrastructure using the FMD API.

### Attribution and Respect

We want to give full credit to the FMD team for their excellent work:

- ‚úÖ **FMD created the protocol** - This integration follows their API design
- ‚úÖ **FMD created the encryption** - We use their RSA + AES-GCM encryption scheme
- ‚úÖ **FMD created the server** - We communicate with their server implementation
- ‚úÖ **FMD created the Android app** - We send commands to their app

This integration would not exist without the FMD team's incredible open source work. We are deeply grateful for their efforts in creating a privacy-respecting, self-hosted device tracking solution.
