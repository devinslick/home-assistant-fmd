      This integration does not support network discovery; all configuration is manual.

      No zeroconf or network discovery supported by FMD; user must add integration manually.

  inject-websession:
    status: partial
    comment: |
      The integration uses aiohttp via the fmd_api package, but does not inject the
      Home Assistant websession directly. This is a minor deviation; fmd_api manages
      its own session.
  strict-typing:
    status: partial
    comment: |
      Type hints are present throughout, but some areas (esp. test code and some
      entity attributes) may lack full strict typing. Can be improved for HA Core
      submission.
