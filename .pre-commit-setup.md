# Pre-Commit Setup Guide

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce code quality standards before commits.

## Installation

### One-time setup:
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Usage

Pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you commit code. If any checks fail, your commit will be blocked. Fix the issues and try committing again.

### Manual checks:
```bash
# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific check (e.g., black)
pre-commit run black --all-files
```

## What Gets Checked

- **Black** - Code formatting (Python)
- **Flake8** - Code style & quality (max 100 chars per line)
- **isort** - Import sorting (compatible with Black)
- **Trailing whitespace** - Removes trailing spaces
- **File ending** - Ensures files end with newline
- **YAML** - Validates YAML syntax
- **JSON** - Validates JSON syntax
- **yamllint** - YAML style consistency (max 120 chars)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Black reformatted files
Black will auto-fix formatting. Just stage and commit again:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

### isort fixed imports
Same as Black - just re-stage and commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

### Flake8 issues
These require manual fixes. Read the error message and correct the code.

### Bypassing hooks (not recommended)
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
Only use this in exceptional circumstances!

## CI Integration

Pre-commit checks also run in GitHub Actions on every push/PR. Code must pass all checks before merging.

## Contributing

Make sure pre-commit is installed before making contributions:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
